<p dir = "auto">
A nice clean Portfolio Website for Designer or developers. Which includes almost everything that you want to show. At first, your name and a big picture. Then the About section shows more info about you with a cool experience card. Then the list of Services that you offer. It also has a hire me card then it also has a section where it shows some recent work, then what your clients say about you. At the bottom contact me form.
